These are the components that are expected
a. Make use of MongoDB at the back
b. User authentication (login, register, reset password)
c. Edit profile
d. on the frontend - make use of react hooks. No class-based components only functional components.
e. Best practiced unit test for react component should be integrated (for both frontend and backend)
f. for backend (please use node with typescript)

React and Apollo Clent workflow/ Getting Started

1. What is react?
   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on react's home page or https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.

2. What is Apollo Client?
   Apollo Client is a complete state management library for JavaScript apps. Simply write a GraphQL query, and Apollo Client will take care of requesting and caching your data, as well as updating your UI.
   Learn more about apollo clients on https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react.

3. What is ANT design?
   Ant Design, a design language for background applications, is refined by Ant UED Team, which aims to uniform the user interface specs for internal background projects, lower the unnecessary cost of design differences and implementation and liberate the resources of design and front-end development.

Instruction
Base Url: http://localhost:3000
Install apollo-boost @apollo/react-hooks graphql
Install ant design via $ npm install antd or $ yarn add antd

1 Clone the repo.
2 npm i to install all the dependencies
3 yarn start or npm start to run the project.

Technology Stack
1 Node(A javascrpt runtime to run our JS code in the server).
2 React (For Building User interface).
3 Apollo Client (To communicate with GraphQL server).
4 ANT Design (To design user interfcae).

TO DO:
1 Implement the best format of routing.
2 Code refactor in over all app.
3 Make the auth page routes working.
